# Secure and Scalable Distributed File System

This project is a distributed file system that is highly secure and scalable to handle large amounts of data. It involves designing and implementing a complex distributed architecture, data replication, and advanced security measures.

## Key Features

- Distributed Architecture: A distributed system that can span multiple nodes or servers, ensuring high availability and redundancy.
- Data Replication: Data replication mechanisms to ensure data integrity and fault tolerance.
- Advanced Security: Incorporates advanced security measures, including encryption, access control lists (ACLs), and authentication to protect sensitive data.
- Scalability: The system is designed to be horizontally scalable, allowing it to handle growing amounts of data and users without significant performance degradation.
- Versioning and History: Keeps track of file versions and maintains a history of changes, allowing users to revert to previous states if needed.
- File Search and Indexing: Efficient search and indexing functionality to quickly locate files within the distributed system.
- User Management: User management features, including user registration, authentication, and authorization for different access levels.
- Web-Based File Explorer: A web-based interface for users to interact with and manage their files within the distributed file system.
- Monitoring and Logging: Incorporates monitoring and logging tools to track system performance and detect issues in real-time.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensures compatibility with various operating systems and devices, allowing users to access their files from anywhere.

## Technologies

- Node.js for the backend server.
- Distributed database systems like Apache Cassandra or Redis for data storage.
- Secure communication protocols like HTTPS and TLS.
- Encryption libraries for data security.
- Web development frameworks like Express.js for building the web interface.
- Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration for scalability.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-scalable-distributed-file-system.git
```
2. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
3. Start the server
```
npm start
```
## Usage

The server starts on port 3000. You can interact with the system through the web interface by navigating to `https://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
